> # Semantics


### There are _Homophones_ and _Homonyms_ in semantics of a language

* Homophones
    * Same Sound
    * Different Spelling  
    * Different Meaning
```
    # Write and Right
    (One means to write on a piece of text and the other means direction)

    # Piece and Peace

    # Writing and Riding (in some countries they sound exact same)
```

* Homonyms
    * Same sound
    * Same Spelling
    * Different Meaning
```
    # Pen and Pen
    (One means the tool for writing and the other is refered to a cage for dog)

    # Bank and Bank
    (One is a river bank and the other is who keeps my money safe)
```
---
```
    # At home when I say, "Mumma mai bank ja rha hu" 😄 She understands that I mean the organisation who keeps my money is what I am reffering to. She will not even consider the "river bank" here. Why ? 

    # The reason is, if two words have same sound and spelling but different meaning, culturally we will agree upon one of the meaning that will be used as a standard term for the commonly used concept. 

    # For example, if I am a fisherman living on a riverside, and I say to my family, I am going to the bank, they would think I am going to the river as that will initially be the more accepted version of the meaning of the word. 

    # Similarly, if I say hockey in Canada, they would think I mean Ice Hockey by default
    If I want to express the concept of field hockey, I will have to explicitely mention "field" hockey here. Because if not, poeple would infer I am talking about the default meaning that is just agreed upon by the society.

> ### Two types of ambiguity in semantics
1. Lexical Ambiguity
    * Word in a sentence can have multiple interpretations
```
    # I am going to the bank
    (It is still ambigious what I mean based on what is the default meaning for the listener of "bank")

    # I like cream a lot
    (It could mean the color or cream of milk. This sentence is ambigious)

```
1. Structural Ambiguity
    * The structure of the sentence reflects more than one interpretations
```
    # I shot an elephant in my pants

    # I shot [an elephant] in my pants
    (Here I shot an elephant while I was wearing my pants)

    # I shot [an elephant in my pants]
    (Here I shot an elephant that was wearing my own pants)
```

> ### Sentential Semantics 

3 types of Sentential Semantics

1. Paraphrasing
    * Take a sentence, turn it into a different sentence while preserving its meaning
```
    # One cannot eat stones
        To
    # It is not possible to eat stones
```
```
    # The book was read by John
        To
    # John read the book
```
1. Entailment
    * The truth of one sentence gaurantees the truth of the other
```
    # I love to eat
        implies that
    # I am capable of eating
```

```
    # My dog is cute
        implies that
    # I own a dog
```
1. Contradiction
    * If a statments contradicts itsel
```
    # P = !P
    (P is equal to NOT P). This is a contradiction
```


> ### Maxims
Explains link between utterances and meaning

* Maxim of Quality
    * Be truthful
    * If you lack evidence of something, do NOT say it

* Maxim of Quantity
    * Do not contribute to more or less thatn you need
```
    # If someone asks, How my day is going
    Do not start rambling about what has happened all day. They do not intend to require that information. They expect a one or two line information. Rambling on is not technically incorrect, however, the world we live in is made of emotion + logic and NOT just pure logic. 
    Here I am over-contributing the information required
```
```
    # If someone asks, How to make a cake
    I reply with, "By putting it in the oven". I am under-contributing it here
```

* Maxim of Relevance
    * Be relevant
```
    # Hey man can I please use your phone ?
    I reply with, "my dogs name is shaby"
    Answer is irrelevant
```

* Maxim of Manner
    * Be Clear
    * Be Brief
    * Avoid Ambiguity
    * Be orderly
```
    # Example would be an essay that keeps on repeating the premises here and there and not being concise. Explaining a 10 word sentence in 25 word sentence
```

---

> ### Implicature

* Implying the hidden meaning in a sentence
    * Implications are used when we want to express an opition without explicitly stating it
```
    If someone is giving a speech and I say, "Well, he is very good at being pretty"
    (I am implyng that his speech was terrible)
```

```
    # Hey Courtney, have you stepped running since we last talked ?
    (I am implying here that she is fat)
```

> ### Presupposition

* Implicit suppositions in sentences

```
    In court, someones asks me
        # Do yo regret stealing a car ?

        (If I say "yes", it means I stole it)
        (If I say "no", it means I stole it)

        The word "regret" in the question holds an implication of me stealing the car.

        The question is carefully crafted to leave me no choice
```

```
    Someone asks me,
        # Would you ever do it again ?
                or
        # Would you like to do it again ?

        The word "again" holds a presupposition of the claim that I have already dont it

        There is a hidden meaning in the sentences

        These assumptions are being made "explicitely"
        (There are explicit assumptions and implicit assumptions - ☀️)

        Police does this all the time, When dealing with police, its best to remain silent
```

> ### What is a predicate ?

* It is usually the action word or description word

```
    # The linguist [loves] frogs
        Arguments - "The linguist", "frogs"
        Predicate - "loves"

    # Miles [hid] his bald head
        Arguments - "Miles", "his bald head"
        Predicate - "hid"

    # Jessie [flew] home
        Arguments - "Jessie", "home"
        Predicate - "flew"

```

### Arguments can take 3 types of roles

* Agent
    * Agent is the initiator of action
```
    [Brad] attacked Steve
    ("Brad" is the initiator)

    [A falling book] hit steve
    ("A falling book" is the initiator)
```

* Experiencer
    * Experiencer is the perciever of an event

```
    [James] saw the moon
    ("James" is the experiencer of the saw)
    ("saw" is the predicate)

    Syntax frightens [Steve] 
    ("Steve" is the experiencer of the fright)
    ("fright" is the predicate)
```

* Theme
    * Also called Patient sometimes
    * It is the entity that undergoes actions, are moved, experienced or percieved

```
    Steve loves [cookeies]
    ("Steve" is the Experiencer)
    ("loves" is the Predicate)
    ("Cookies" is the Theme)

    A falling rock hit [Steve]
    ("A falling rock" is the Experiencer)
    ("hit" is the Predicate)
    ("Steve" is the Theme)

```
