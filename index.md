## 5 aspects of Language
1. Syntax
1. Semantics
1. Morphology
1. Phonetics
1. Phonology

Syntax is the structure of language  
In english, we have _Subject Verb Object_ word order (SVO)

> ### _I hit the ball_
Here __I__ is the _subject_, __hit__ is the _verb_ and __the ball__ is the _object_

In japan, the word order is subject object verb. (SOV)


### There are 2 types of grammers
1. Prescriptive 
1. Descriptive 

Prescriptive grammer is taught in school whereas descriptive grammer is what is used in the linguistics. 

```
> According to Descriptive grammer, I aint got no love is a perfectly valid sentence as it makes sense even with the prescence of double negation. 
Presctiptive garmmer disagrees wit this.
We follow  DESCRIPTIVE GRAMMER in LINGUISTICS
```

> #### Word Classes and Constituency  
Types of Nouns

Types of Verbs
1. ## Intransitive

> ## Tests for checking constituency
1. Substitution 
    * Substitute a part of sentence with another sentence and see if it still makes sense. If it does, it means the replaced part of the sentence is a single unit of the sentence.
    ```
     ### This test in not that sufficient
    ```
    ---
    ```
      The boys play at school
      [The boys] play at school
      [I] play at school
    ```
1. Movement
    * Move a part of the sentence around to see if the sentence still makes sense
    ```
      The boys play at school
      The boys play [at school]
      [At school] the boys play
      ([At school] is a constituent here as sentence makes sense after moving it around)
    ```
    ---
    ```
      ### [School] the boys play at
      (This does not really makes sense. Therefore, "School" is not a constituent)
    ```
1. Question (QA)
    * Ask question by omitting a part of the sentence 
    ```
      The boys play at school
      The boys play [where] ? 
      (Answer to the where is "at school". Therefore, at school is a constituent according to this rule)
    ```
    ---
    ```
      The boys play at school
      [Who] plays at school ?
      (answer to Who is "The boys". Therefore ,The boys is a constituent)
    ```
    ---
    ```
      The boys [do] [what]
      The boys play at school. 
      (Play at school is also a constituent here. A constituent can be a compound of sub constituents)
    ```
1. Coordination
    ```
      The boys play [at school] and [at home] ðŸ˜„ iska mjhe bhi nai pta mtlb haha
      But here, what the lecture said is, [at school] is a constituent and so it [at home]
      ### Research about this khud ke time pe
    ```
