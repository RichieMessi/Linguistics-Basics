> # Morphology 

> ### Morpheme

* The smallest unit of a composition of words

```
    # Train[er]
    # Fatt[er]
    ("er" is a comparative morpheme)

    # Train[s]
    # Fat[s]
    ("s" is a plural morpheme)

    # These types of morphemes cannot exist individually on their own
      but they have a unit of meaning attached to them 

    # Tempt[ing]
    ("ing" is a progressive morpheme that says the act is ongoing)

    # Judge[er][s]
    (3 morphemes in total present "judge", "er", "s")
```

> ### 2 types of morphemes

* Free Morphemes
    * Can exist all alone individually

* Bound Morphemes
    * Cannot be used stand alone

```

    # [prefix][infix][suffix]

    # Jumper
    ("jump" is the free morpheme and prefix)
    ("er" is the bound morpheme and suffix)

    # Implied
    ("imply" is the free mprpheme and prefix)
    ("ed" is the bound morpheme and suffix)

    # Faithful
    ("faith" is the free morpheme and prefix)
    ("ful" is the bound morpheme and suffix)

    # Dehydrated
    ("de" is the bound morpheme and prefix)
    ("hydrate" is the free morpheme and infix)
    ("ed" is the bound mprpheme and suffix)

    # De[couple]
    # De[crease]
    # Im[possible]
    # Im[capable]
```

> ### Derivational Morphemes

* Change the category or alteration of meaning

```
    # Sing[er]
    (From an act of singing, to a person who sings)


    # Poison[ous]
    (From a substance to the property of a substance)

```

> ### Inflectional Morphemes

* Changes reflect grammatical agreement or features

> ### Internal Change Morphemes

* Morphology is sometimes concatenative but not always
* Change can be introduced on the inside of word or at the end or beginning 

```
    # Sing
    ("singed" does not make sense)
    ("sang" makes more sense)
    (Sang = Sing + [intent of conversion to past tense])

    (This is called "partial suppletion". It means there was a very slight change)
```
---
```
    # Jump
    ("jamp" does not make sense)
    ("jumped" makes sense)
    (Jumped = Jump + [intent of conversion to past tense] + "ed")

    (Here concatenation takes place without introducing any change on the internal structure of the word)


    Another case is:
        # Kids = Kid + [intent of conversion to plural] + "s"
        # Children = Child + [intent of conversion to plural] + "ren"
        # Tables = Table + [intent of conversion to plural] + "s"
        (Look at the difference of morphemes used at the end to change the word from singular to plural)
```

> ### Suppletion 

* Completely change the morpheme

```
    # I am + [intent of conversion to past] = I was ðŸ¤”
        Similarly
    # I go + [intent of conversion to past] = I went ðŸ¤” 
```

> ### Reduplication 

* Repeat all or a part of the base

```
    # so-so
    # teeny-weeny
    # itsy-bitsy
```

> ### Stress

```
    # Record - To record a sound or data
    # Record - To break a record
    (These both words are pronounced differently with slight variation with stress at different places)

    # Project - To project confidence
    # Project - To work on a new business project
    (These both words are pronounced differently with slight variation with stress at different places)
```

1. Backformation
1. Accronym
1. Onomotapia

> ### Compounding

* New mprpheme (concept) after joining 2 other morphemes

```
    # [Noun] + [Noun] = [Noun]
    ("Steam" and "Boat") = Steamboat

    [concept] + [concept] = [concept]  
    (When I think of a steamboat, I think of the actual verhicle that floats on the sea and runs on steam)

    (I do not think of some stram flying around a boat)
```


```
    # [Verb] + [Noun] = [Noun]
    ("Break" and "Dance") = Breakdance

    [concept] + [concept] = [concept]
    (When I think of breakdance, I think of a type of dance)
    (I do not think of someone dancing on their break from study or work)
    (I do not think of someone breaking stuff while dancing)
```

```
    # [Preposition] + [Noun] = [Noun]
    ("Over" and "Load") = Overload

    [concept] + [concept] = [concept]
    (When I think of overlaod, I think of a level that has been reached above the level that is considered normal)
    (I do not think of something jumping over a load)
```

```
    [Noun] + [Noun] = [Noun]
    ("Butter" and "Fly") = Butterfly

    [concept] + [concept] = [concept]
    (When I think of a butterfly, I think of an insect with wings that can fly)
    (I do not think of butter flying in the kitchen)
```

> ### Clipping

* small part of the word is used

```
    # [Examination] = [Exam]
    # [Dormitory] = [Dorm]
    # [Mathematics] = [Maths]
    # [Gymnasium] = [Gym]
```

> ### Blending

* Merging 2 words
* Merging is different than blending as compounding just joins 2 words together as 2 pieces of a leggo blocks
    * Blending is more like mixing coffee and cream together. 
    * Blending involves adding or deleting part of the input words

```
    # [Motel] = [Motorist] + [Hotel]
    # [Spork] = [Spoon] + [Fork]
    
    [concept] + [concept] = [concept]
```

> ### Backformation

* Creating a base form that did not exist
* Backformation is different than Clipping
    * ðŸ˜„ exactly how voh mjhe khud nai pta

```
    # [Orientation] = [Orient] + [ation]
    # [Orientation] = [Orientate] + [ion]

    (I can choose the prefix how I like but it effectively change the suffix)

    # [Backformation] = [Backform] + [ation]
    # [Backformation] = [Backformate] + [ion]
```

> ### Acronym

* Initial letters of a complex word is used
* for ease of use

```
    # [Scuba] = [s]elf + [c]ontained + [u]nderwater + [b]reathing + [a]pparatus

    # [Laser] = [l]ight + [a]mplification + by + [s]timulating + [e]mmision + of + [r]adiation
```

> ### Onomotapia

*  Resembles sound of an object

```
    In English
        # Meow
        Cats say "meow"

    In Japanese
        # Myaa
        Cats say "myaa"
```

```
    # Meowmix = [Meow] + [Mix]
    ("meowmix" is a brand of cat food)
```

```
    # Laserbeam = [Laser] + [beam]
    (compination of an accronym and noun)
```
